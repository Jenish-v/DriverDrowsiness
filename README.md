# DriverDrowsiness
Python application uses the trained data to predict the drowsiness state in the drive while driving and also detect the human emotion.

A system which installed a car on a phone which has access to a camera that detects the face of the driver and predicts the drowsiness of the driver via an algorithm we designed. This prediction results will be connected to a buzzer which plays whenever drowsiness State detects. We also plan to make an algorithm which detects the mood of the driver and plays songs accordingly. This system will reduce the number of accidents and make riding.


I have given the repository of all the files that may needed to run the program on your local pc, given program is standing at the accuracy of arrond 70% which yet can be improved by the bigger data set.
